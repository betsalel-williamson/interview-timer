# Task: Implement Square Timer Buttons

## Objective

Update the individual quick timer buttons (30s, 1m, 2m, 5m, 5s, 10s) to be square-shaped with clear time labels, matching the visual style of other button groups in the application.

## Requirements Traceability

This task implements the user story requirements for square timer buttons with clear time labels, improving visual consistency and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Individual timer buttons are styled as squares with consistent dimensions
- [ ] Time labels (30s, 1m, 2m, 5m, 5s, 10s) are clearly visible on each button
- [ ] Buttons maintain the same functionality as before (adding timers with correct durations)
- [ ] Hover effects are applied consistently across all square buttons
- [ ] Layout is responsive and works on mobile devices
- [ ] Styling is consistent with the existing design system

## Test Strategy

### Visual Testing

- Verify buttons are square-shaped with appropriate dimensions
- Confirm time labels are clearly readable
- Check hover effects work correctly
- Validate responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Functional Testing

- Test that clicking each button adds a timer with the correct duration
- Verify button interactions work as expected
- Confirm no regression in existing functionality

### Automated Testing

- Update existing tests to account for new button styling
- Add tests for button dimensions and visual properties
- Ensure all timer creation functionality still works correctly

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add CSS Styling for Square Buttons

- Create `.individual-quick-timers` CSS class with flexbox layout
- Style individual buttons to be square with consistent dimensions
- Add hover effects and transitions
- Ensure responsive design for mobile devices

### Step 2: Update HTML Structure (if needed)

- Review current HTML structure for individual quick timer buttons
- Make any necessary adjustments to support square button layout
- Ensure proper semantic structure is maintained

### Step 3: Test and Validate

- Test button functionality across different browsers
- Verify responsive behavior on various screen sizes
- Run existing test suite to ensure no regressions
- Perform visual testing to confirm design consistency

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain existing button functionality and event handlers
- Use consistent color scheme and design patterns from the existing codebase
- Ensure accessibility standards are met (proper contrast, focus states)
- Follow the existing CSS architecture and naming conventions
- Consider performance impact of any new CSS rules

## Dependencies

- Existing HTML structure in `index.html`
- Current CSS styling system in `src/style.css`
- Alpine.js functionality for button interactions
- Existing test suite for validation
