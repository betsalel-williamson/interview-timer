# Add New Timer Modal

## User Persona

**Name:** Interview Coordinator
**Description:** A professional who manages multiple interview sessions simultaneously, often running several timers at once to track different interview phases or multiple candidates. They need to quickly add new timers while managing existing ones and prefer streamlined workflows that don't interrupt their current timer management tasks. They value quick access to timer creation without losing focus on their active timers.

## User Story

**As a** Interview Coordinator
**I want to** add new timers through a modal dialog accessible from the main toolbar
**so that** I can quickly create additional timers without scrolling to the bottom of the page or losing sight of my active timers

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Success Metric

- **WHEN** I click the "Add New Timer" button in the toolbar **THEN** I SHALL see a modal dialog appear with timer input fields
- **WHEN** I enter valid minutes and seconds in the modal **THEN** I SHALL be able to create a new timer that appears in the timer list
- **WHEN** I close the modal **THEN** I SHALL return to the main timer interface with my existing timers unchanged

### Secondary Success Metrics

- **WHEN** the modal is open **THEN** I SHALL see input fields for minutes and seconds with the same validation as the existing form
- **WHEN** I click outside the modal or press Escape **THEN** the modal SHALL close without creating a timer
- **WHEN** I submit the modal form **THEN** the modal SHALL close and the new timer SHALL be added to the timer list
- **WHEN** I have the auto-start setting enabled **THEN** the new timer SHALL start automatically when created through the modal
- **WHEN** I enter invalid values in the modal **THEN** I SHALL see appropriate error messages without the modal closing

### Verification Requirements

- All metrics can be verified through visual observation and automated testing
- Modal behavior can be tested by opening, interacting with, and closing the modal
- Timer creation can be verified by checking that new timers appear in the timer list
- Form validation can be tested by entering various valid and invalid values
