# Interview Timer User Story

## User Persona

**Name:** Interview Candidate
**Description:** A software engineer preparing for technical coding interviews. They need to practice different interview phases with specific time constraints to build muscle memory and confidence. They're studying for companies that use structured interview formats with timed sections for problem understanding, coding, testing, and optimization. They value precision timing, clear phase transitions, and the ability to practice realistic interview conditions without external distractions.

## User Story

**As an** Interview Candidate
**I want to** set up multiple timers for different interview phases and start them all simultaneously
**so that** I can practice realistic interview timing and build confidence for structured coding interviews.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Timer Setup

- **WHEN** I enter minutes and seconds for each interview phase **THEN** I SHALL see the timer added to my interview practice list
- **WHEN** I add multiple phase timers **THEN** I SHALL see all interview phases displayed clearly with their durations
- **WHEN** I enter invalid time values **THEN** I SHALL receive a clear error message

### Interview Practice Management

- **WHEN** I click the "Start All" button **THEN** all interview phase timers SHALL begin counting down simultaneously
- **WHEN** timers are running **THEN** I SHALL see the remaining time count down in real-time for each interview phase
- **WHEN** an interview phase timer reaches zero **THEN** I SHALL hear an alert sound for 2 seconds
- **WHEN** an interview phase timer reaches zero **THEN** the webpage SHALL flash to signal phase transition

### Interview Practice Experience

- **WHEN** I set up the specific interview timers (30 sec for problem understanding, 6 min for initial coding, 19 min for testing/debugging, 20 min for optimization) **THEN** I SHALL be able to start them all with one action
- **WHEN** I want to reset the interview practice **THEN** I SHALL be able to clear all timers and start over
- **WHEN** I use the application **THEN** it SHALL work reliably without requiring internet connection

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metric

- **App Reliability**: User can complete full interview practice sessions without timer failures or technical issues

### Secondary Metrics

- **Setup Efficiency**: User can quickly configure and start practice sessions without confusion
- **Alert Effectiveness**: Audio and visual alerts successfully signal phase transitions during practice
- **User Satisfaction**: User finds the app helpful for interview preparation and would recommend it to others

## Out of Scope

- Timer persistence across browser sessions
- Customizable alert sounds
- Timer sharing or collaboration features
- Mobile app version
- Advanced timer features (pauses, intervals, etc.)
- User accounts or data storage
