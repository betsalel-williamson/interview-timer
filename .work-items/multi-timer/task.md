### Task 5: Alpine.js Timer Display and Countdown UI

**Objective**: Implement Alpine.js-powered visual display of timers with reactive countdown updates

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Timers display using Alpine.js `x-for` loops

- Timer status is visually indicated using Alpine.js `x-bind:class`
- Countdown updates in real-time using Alpine.js reactive data
- Completed timers are clearly marked with Alpine.js state changes
- Individual timer components use Alpine.js `x-data` for encapsulation

**Requirements Traceability**: User Story - Timer Management acceptance criteria

**Test Strategy**:

- Visual verification of Alpine.js timer display layout
- Test Alpine.js countdown accuracy with short timers
- Verify Alpine.js status indicators change appropriately
- Confirm Alpine.js reactivity updates display automatically

---

### Task 6: Alpine.js Timer Synchronization and Start All Functionality

**Objective**: Implement Alpine.js-powered ability to start all timers simultaneously

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All timers count down in perfect synchronization via Alpine.js state
- Running state is properly managed globally using Alpine.js reactive data
- Individual timer controls work correctly with Alpine.js event handling
- Timer state transitions are handled properly via Alpine.js state management

**Requirements Traceability**: User Story - Timer Management acceptance criteria

**Test Strategy**:

- Test Alpine.js synchronization with multiple timers of different durations
- Verify all timers start simultaneously via Alpine.js state
- Test individual timer controls during running state with Alpine.js
- Confirm Alpine.js state management handles transitions correctly

---

### Task 7: Audio Alert System

**Objective**: Implement audio alerts using Web Audio API for timer completion

**Acceptance Criteria**:
