# Synchronized Timer Countdown

## User Persona

**Name:** Interview Coordinator
**Description:** A professional who manages multiple interview sessions simultaneously, often running several timers at once to track different interview phases or multiple candidates. They need to quickly scan multiple timers and prefer visual consistency over millisecond precision. They value a clean, unified visual experience that reduces cognitive load when monitoring multiple countdowns.

## User Story

**As a** Interview Coordinator
**I want to** see all timer countdowns decrement in perfect unison
**so that** I can quickly scan multiple timers without visual distraction from numbers changing at different times

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Success Metric

- **WHEN** multiple timers are running **THEN** all timer displays SHALL decrement simultaneously at system clock second boundaries
- **WHEN** I observe multiple running timers **THEN** I SHALL see all countdown numbers change at exactly the same moment

### Secondary Success Metrics

- **WHEN** timers are synchronized **THEN** the visual experience SHALL be less distracting than unsynchronized countdowns
- **WHEN** a timer is started at any moment **THEN** it SHALL align to the next system clock second boundary within 1 second
- **WHEN** timers are running **THEN** the synchronization SHALL be maintained consistently over time
- **WHEN** I start multiple timers at different times **THEN** they SHALL all align to the same second boundaries after the first update

### Verification Requirements

- All metrics can be verified through visual observation and automated testing
- Synchronization can be tested by starting multiple timers and observing simultaneous countdown changes
- System clock alignment can be verified by checking that updates occur at second boundaries (e.g., 12:34:56.000, 12:34:57.000)
