- [ ] Error messages display for invalid inputs

### Test Strategy

- Unit tests for modal component functionality
- Integration tests with existing timer state
- E2E tests for mobile modal interactions
- Input validation testing
- Error handling testing

### Requirements Traceability

- User Story: "WHEN I click on any timer card on mobile THEN I SHALL see a modal dialog open for editing"
- Design: Mobile timer editing modal extending existing modal infrastructure

## Task 4: Mobile Detection and Conditional Behavior

### Objective

Implement mobile device detection and conditional timer interaction behavior (modal editing on mobile, inline editing on desktop).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Mobile device detection function implemented
- [ ] Timer click behavior differs between mobile and desktop
- [ ] Mobile devices open edit modal on timer click
- [ ] Desktop devices maintain existing inline editing behavior
- [ ] Detection works across different mobile browsers
- [ ] Fallback behavior for edge cases

### Test Strategy

- Unit tests for mobile detection logic
- Cross-browser testing on mobile and desktop
- User agent testing for various mobile devices
- Fallback behavior testing

### Requirements Traceability

- User Story: "WHEN I click on any timer card on mobile THEN I SHALL see a modal dialog open for editing"
- Design: Mobile detection with conditional interaction behavior

## Task 5: Mobile Modal UI Implementation

### Objective

Implement the HTML structure and styling for the mobile timer edit modal, ensuring touch-friendly interface.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Modal HTML structure added to index.html
- [ ] Modal styling optimized for mobile screens
- [ ] Touch-friendly input controls (minimum 44px height)
- [ ] Proper modal backdrop and close functionality
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader accessibility
- [ ] Modal animations and transitions

### Test Strategy

- Visual regression tests for modal appearance
- Accessibility testing for screen readers
- Touch interaction testing
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Cross-browser modal functionality testing

### Requirements Traceability

- User Story: "WHEN I am in the timer editing modal on mobile THEN I SHALL be able to modify the timer duration using touch-friendly input controls"
- Design: Mobile-optimized modal UI with touch-friendly controls

## Task 6: Integration and State Management

### Objective

Integrate mobile timer editing modal with existing timer state management and ensure proper data flow.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Modal integrates with existing Alpine.js timer state
- [ ] Timer duration updates reflect immediately in main display
- [ ] Modal state properly resets on open/close
- [ ] Error handling integrates with existing error display patterns
- [ ] Modal works with all timer states (ready, running, paused, completed)
- [ ] No conflicts with existing timer functionality

### Test Strategy

- Integration tests with existing timer functionality
- State management testing
- Error handling integration testing
- Timer state transition testing
- Regression testing for existing features

### Requirements Traceability

- User Story: "WHEN I save changes in the timer editing modal THEN I SHALL see the updated timer duration reflected in the main timer display"
- Design: Integration with existing timer state management

## Task 7: Mobile Testing and Validation

### Objective

Comprehensive testing of mobile timer optimization across devices and browsers.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Visual testing on actual iPhone devices (various sizes)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on mobile Safari and Chrome
- [ ] Performance testing for mobile rendering
- [ ] Accessibility testing for mobile screen readers
- [ ] Touch interaction testing
- [ ] Responsive design validation across breakpoints
- [ ] Timer visibility count validation (8+ on large screens, 6+ on small screens)

### Test Strategy

- Manual testing on physical mobile devices
- Automated visual regression testing
- Performance profiling on mobile devices
- Accessibility audit with mobile screen readers
- User acceptance testing with mobile users

### Requirements Traceability

- User Story: All acceptance criteria validation
- Design: Comprehensive mobile optimization validation

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies

- Task 1 must be completed before Task 2 (CSS changes before component changes)
- Task 3 must be completed before Task 4 (modal component before integration)
- Task 5 can be developed in parallel with Task 3
- Task 6 depends on completion of Tasks 3, 4, and 5
- Task 7 should be performed after all other tasks are complete

### Risk Mitigation

- Maintain backward compatibility with existing desktop functionality
- Implement feature flags for mobile detection to allow easy rollback
- Test thoroughly on actual devices, not just browser emulation
- Ensure accessibility standards are maintained across all changes

### Success Criteria

- At least 8 timers visible on large iPhone screens (430px+ width)
- Touch-friendly timer editing modal on mobile devices
- No regression in existing desktop functionality
- Improved mobile user experience with intuitive timer management
- Maintained accessibility and performance standards
