# Mobile Timer Optimization User Story

## User Persona

**Mobile Interview Practitioner**
A professional who conducts or participates in interviews using mobile devices, particularly large smartphones like iPhone Pro Max models. This persona needs to efficiently manage multiple timers during interview sessions while maintaining clear visibility of all active timers and having quick access to timer editing functionality.

## User Story

**As a** Mobile Interview Practitioner
**I want to** see at least 8 timers simultaneously on my large iPhone screen and edit individual timers through a modal interface
**so that** I can efficiently manage multiple interview timing scenarios without scrolling and have quick access to timer adjustments when needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Success Metric

**WHEN** I view the timer application on a large iPhone screen (430px+ width) **THEN** I SHALL see at least 8 timer cards visible simultaneously without scrolling.

### Secondary Success Metrics

**WHEN** I click on any timer card on mobile **THEN** I SHALL see a modal dialog open for editing that timer's duration.

**WHEN** I am in the timer editing modal on mobile **THEN** I SHALL be able to modify the timer duration using touch-friendly input controls.

**WHEN** I save changes in the timer editing modal **THEN** I SHALL see the updated timer duration reflected in the main timer display.

**WHEN** I cancel changes in the timer editing modal **THEN** I SHALL return to the main view with the original timer duration unchanged.

**WHEN** I close the timer editing modal **THEN** I SHALL return to the main timer view with all timers still visible and functional.

**WHEN** I view the application on different mobile screen sizes **THEN** I SHALL see an appropriate number of timers visible based on screen real estate (minimum 6 timers on smaller screens, 8+ on large screens).

**WHEN** I interact with timers on mobile **THEN** I SHALL experience touch-friendly button sizes and spacing that meet mobile accessibility standards.

## Verification Requirements

All success metrics must be verifiable through:

- Visual testing on actual mobile devices or mobile browser emulation
- Automated tests that verify timer visibility counts at different screen sizes
- User interaction tests that confirm modal functionality works correctly
- Cross-browser testing on mobile Safari and Chrome
- Accessibility testing for touch targets and screen reader compatibility

## Out of Scope

- Desktop timer editing modal (existing inline editing remains for desktop)
- Timer reordering or drag-and-drop functionality
- Bulk timer editing capabilities
- Timer grouping or categorization features
- Advanced timer customization options
- Offline functionality or data persistence
- Timer sharing or collaboration features
