# User Story: Configurable Audio Testing Visibility

## User Persona

**Name:** Interview Practice User
**Description:** A professional preparing for technical interviews who uses the multi-timer application for practice sessions. They need a clean, uncluttered interface for their main use case (timing practice sessions) but occasionally need access to audio testing functionality for troubleshooting or verification purposes.

## User Story

**As a** Interview Practice User
**I want to** see a clean, uncluttered settings interface focused on the essential timer controls
**so that** I can quickly access the features I need for my interview practice sessions without being distracted by advanced options I don't typically use.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Acceptance Criteria

- **WHEN** I open the timer application **THEN** I SHALL see a clean settings section with only the essential audio and visual alert controls
- **WHEN** I look at the settings **THEN** I SHALL NOT see any advanced audio testing options that might confuse me
- **WHEN** I use the timer application **THEN** I SHALL be able to focus on timing my practice sessions without visual distractions

### Secondary Acceptance Criteria

- **WHEN** audio testing is available **THEN** I SHALL have the same testing functionality as before
- **WHEN** I use the application **THEN** I SHALL have a streamlined experience that doesn't overwhelm me with options

## Success Metrics

## Value Proposition

This feature creates a better user experience by presenting a clean, focused interface that helps users concentrate on their primary goal of timing interview practice sessions. By hiding advanced technical options that most users don't need, the application becomes more approachable and less intimidating, while still providing access to those features when they're actually needed for troubleshooting audio issues.
