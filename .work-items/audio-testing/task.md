# Task Breakdown: Audio System Testing and Metronome Features

## Overview

Implement checkbox-controlled audio testing and metronome features that play click sounds every second to allow users to verify the audio system is working and optionally maintain consistent pacing during their interview practice sessions.

## Task Sequence

### Task 1: Extend AudioManager with Click Sound and Metronome Capabilities

**Objective:** Add methods to AudioManager for generating click sounds for both testing and metronome features, plus enhanced timer completion alerts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AudioManager has `playClickSound()` method for audio testing
- AudioManager has `playMetronomeClick()` method for subtle metronome sounds
- AudioManager has `startClickTesting()`, `stopClickTesting()`, `startMetronome(hasActiveTimers)`, and `stopMetronome()` methods
- Enhanced `playAlert()` method with distinct 2-second ascending tone pattern
- All click sounds are generated using Web Audio API oscillator
- Separate intervals are properly managed and cleaned up for each feature
- All methods handle audio context initialization gracefully

**Test Strategy:**

- Unit tests for AudioManager click sound and metronome methods
- Verify click sounds are generated at correct intervals for both features
- Test proper cleanup of intervals and audio resources
- Verify distinct sound patterns for metronome vs timer completion alerts
- Verify metronome only plays when timers are actively running

**Requirements Traceability:**

- User Story: "I want to test the audio system with a click sound every second" and "I want to use a metronome with subtle click sounds"
- Design: AudioManager Extension section

### Task 2: Add Audio Testing and Metronome State to Main Component

**Objective:** Add state management for both audio testing and metronome features in the main Alpine.js component.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Component has `audioTestingEnabled` and `metronomeEnabled` settings in settings object
- Component has `audioTestingIntervalId`, `audioTestingActive`, and `metronomeActive` state properties
- Component has methods to start/stop both audio testing and metronome
- Both feature states are properly initialized and cleaned up
- Features can be controlled independently

**Test Strategy:**

- Unit tests for both audio testing and metronome state management
- Integration tests for both feature lifecycles
- Verify state updates trigger UI changes correctly for both features
- Test independent operation of both features

**Requirements Traceability:**

- User Story: "I can verify the audio alerts will work during my interview practice sessions" and "I want to maintain consistent pacing"
- Design: Data Models section

### Task 3: Implement Audio Testing and Metronome UI Controls

**Objective:** Add separate checkboxes and visual indicators for both audio testing and metronome features in the settings section.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Settings section has separate checkboxes for "Enable Audio Testing" and "Enable Metronome"
- Individual visual indicators show when each feature is active
- Error messages display if either feature fails to start
- UI updates reflect state changes for both features independently
- Clear visual distinction between testing and metronome functionality

**Test Strategy:**

- UI tests for both checkbox interactions
- Visual regression tests for settings section with both features
- Error handling tests for both feature failures
- Test independent operation of both UI controls

**Requirements Traceability:**

- User Story: "I SHALL see a visual indicator showing the testing is running" and "I SHALL see a visual indicator showing the metronome is running"
- Design: UI Components section

### Task 4: Integrate Audio Testing and Metronome with Component Lifecycle

**Objective:** Connect both audio testing and metronome functionality with the main component's initialization and cleanup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Audio testing starts/stops when its checkbox is enabled/disabled
- Metronome starts/stops when its checkbox is enabled/disabled
- Both features are properly cleaned up when component is destroyed
- Audio context is initialized when either feature starts if needed
- Features can operate independently without interference
- Timer completion alerts remain distinct from metronome clicks
- Metronome only plays when timers are actively running

**Test Strategy:**

- Integration tests for complete workflows of both features
- Lifecycle tests for proper cleanup of both features
- Error handling tests for audio context initialization failures
- Test independent operation and cleanup of both features

**Requirements Traceability:**

- User Story: "I SHALL hear a click sound every second" and "I SHALL stop hearing the click sounds" for both features
- Design: Component Responsibilities section

## Implementation Notes

- Follow TDD methodology: write failing tests first, implement minimal code to pass, then refactor
- Ensure both audio testing and metronome don't interfere with existing timer functionality
- Handle browser autoplay policies gracefully for both features
- Provide clear error messages for audio initialization failures
- Use consistent naming conventions with existing codebase
- Ensure metronome clicks are subtle and distinct from timer completion alerts
- Allow independent operation of both features

## Dependencies

- Existing AudioManager class
- Existing Alpine.js component structure
- Web Audio API support in target browsers
