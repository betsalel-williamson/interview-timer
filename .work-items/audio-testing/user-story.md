# User Story: Audio System Testing and Metronome

## User Persona

**Name:** Interview Practice User
**Description:** A professional preparing for technical interviews who needs to practice timing their responses. They rely on audio cues to know when their practice time is up, but want to verify that the audio system is working properly before starting their practice session. They also benefit from having a subtle metronome to help maintain consistent pacing during their practice.

## User Story

**As a** Interview Practice User
**I want to** test the audio system and optionally use a metronome with subtle click sounds
**so that** I can verify the audio alerts will work during my interview practice sessions and maintain consistent pacing

## Acceptance Criteria

### Audio Testing Feature

- **WHEN** I enable the audio testing feature **THEN** I SHALL hear a click sound every second
- **WHEN** I disable the audio testing feature **THEN** I SHALL stop hearing the click sounds
- **WHEN** the audio testing is active **THEN** I SHALL see a visual indicator showing the testing is running
- **WHEN** audio testing fails to start **THEN** I SHALL see a clear error message explaining the issue

### Metronome Feature

- **WHEN** the metronome feature is enabled by default **THEN** I SHALL hear a subtle click sound every second only when timers are actively running
- **WHEN** I disable the metronome feature **THEN** I SHALL stop hearing the metronome clicks
- **WHEN** the metronome is active **THEN** I SHALL see a visual indicator showing the metronome is running
- **WHEN** no timers are running **THEN** I SHALL not hear metronome clicks even when metronome is enabled
- **WHEN** I start timers with metronome enabled **THEN** I SHALL hear an immediate metronome click without delay
- **WHEN** a timer completes **THEN** I SHALL hear a distinct 2-second alert sound that is different from the metronome clicks
- **WHEN** metronome fails to start **THEN** I SHALL see a clear error message explaining the issue

## Success Metrics

- **Primary Metric:** User can successfully verify audio system functionality before starting practice sessions
- **Secondary Metrics:**
  - Reduced user frustration from unexpected audio failures during practice
  - Increased confidence in the timer system reliability
  - Improved pacing consistency during practice sessions with metronome
  - Clear distinction between metronome clicks and timer completion alerts
